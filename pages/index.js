            As smart working becomes inevitable due to several reasons e.g.,
            cost, covid etc. Users must be careful in making the right choice on
            the internet especially with the upsurge of cybercriminals. <br />

            We are conducting a short survey with users on how they take
            critical decisions during online activities. The online survey
            should take you maximum [15 minutes]. You will at a certain point be
            asked to assume some roles e.g., secretary, sales representative, or
            an employee. The study aims at analyzing user perception on certain
            scenario. <br />
            <br />
            There are three (3) short sections A, B, and C. In all sections you
            will be expected to choose an option or provide short answers.{" "}

            research is voluntary.
